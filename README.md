# MERN Authentication Project

A robust, production-ready authentication system built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project is designed to serve as a secure authentication backbone for any e-commerce platform or application requiring user login, registration, and session management.

## Features

- User registration with email verification
- Secure login with JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Google OAuth integration
- Profile management (including image upload)
- Protected routes and role-based access
- Password reset and account recovery
- Easily customizable and extendable for any e-commerce or platform use-case

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux Toolkit, Axios, Material UI (or Tailwind)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Authentication:** JWT, bcrypt
- **OAuth:** Google OAuth 2.0
- **Storage (Optional):** Firebase for profile image uploads

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or Atlas)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-authentication.git
   cd mern-authentication
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory:
     ```
     NODE_ENV=development
     PORT=5000
     MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
     JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
     ```
   - For image upload, add Firebase or other storage keys as needed.

4. **Start the application:**
   - **Backend:**
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm start
     ```
   - **Frontend:**
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm run dev
     ```

## Usage

- Register a new user or sign in with Google.
- Login to access protected routes.
- Update profile and upload profile image.
- Reset password via email.
- Integrate with your e-commerce platform as a plug-and-play authentication module.

## Testing

- Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test API endpoints.
- Frontend and backend both support unit and integration tests (Jest, React Testing Library).

---

## Security

- All passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage.
- JWT tokens are used for secure authentication and authorization.
- Environment variables are used for all secrets and keys.
- Input validation and sanitization are enforced on all endpoints.
